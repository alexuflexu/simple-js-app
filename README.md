# Pokedex App

This project is an online Pokedex (Pocket Monsters) app that fetches data from the PokeAPI. It displays a list of 150 Pokemon from the API as buttons and allows the user to click each button to find out more about the Pokemon.

## Features

**Pokemon Repository**: A repository is created from the details of the API that are fetched using JavaScript and displayed as button elements.

**Pokemon Details**: Clicking a Pokemon button opens a modal built with Bootstrap that displays details such as the Pokemon's name, height, and image.

**JavaScript ES6**: The majority of this app's functionality is written in JavaScript ES6, which allows for ease of use on the vast majority of browsers and devices.

**Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is used for the display of the modals and the style/responsiveness of the page and its buttons.

**PokeAPI**: The PokeAPI is used to fetch the data about the Pokemon. It is a RESTful API that provides data about the Pokemon - their names, heights, images, and more.

**Code Formatting**: Prettier is used to format the code correctly and notify of any code style errors in JS, CSS, and HTML.

**Dependencies**: Dependencies in the app also include the PokeAPI for fetching data about the Pokemon and the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) where most of the functionality is stored in the JavaScript file.
